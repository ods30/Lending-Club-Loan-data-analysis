# Lending-Club-Loan-data-analysis
Lending Club is a platform which allows borrowers to ask for loans, and investors to fund them. The borrowers have to return the loan with interest rates. Borrowers with high credit scores will get low interest rates and the opposite. The higher the risk the higher the ROI. The data set includes information about funded loans from Lending Club platform; It includes information about the loans, the borrowers and what are the loans status.

Our goal is to help investors decide if they should fund a specific loan or not. We should note that good loan and bad loan can be interpreted in different ways. I will introduce the different approaches and select one of them.
